								<tr><td>TRS-80
Model II is Radio Shack's fastest and most powerful microcomputer. It
is an extremely efficient business tool that can speed through routine
tasks, store vast amounts of data, provide timely information for
decisionmaking, and much more-at costs significantly below the
industry's "going price" for comparable computers. All this, yet it is
easy to use!</td></tr>
								<tr><td></td></tr>
								<tr><td>Since
introduction in mid 1979. Model II systems have brought the benefits of
affordable data processing to businesses and professional people
everywhere. Its remarkable combination of high power and low cost make
it "just right" for countless applications. Even if you own a "maxi"
computer, Model II can do many jobs that are "too hot" to wait for
shared computer time and those too small for costeffective handling by
your mainframe.</td></tr>
								<tr><td></td></tr>
								<tr><td>Radio
Shack supports the Model II with a growing line of software and total
before-and-after- the-sale service. Our inexpensive user-oriented,
well-documented software includes programs for payroll, accounting,
inventory control, mailing lists, with more to come. This allows your
Model II to go to work quickly with no formal operator training. Model
II features easy expandability, compatibilty with external equipment,
communications and multi- language programming abilities, as well as
low start-up and operating costs. We invite you to investigate the
advantages of owning or leasing a TRS-80 Model II system. Why not
arrange for a TRS-80 demonstration soon?</td></tr>
								<tr><td></td></tr>
								<tr><td><b>The Model II Hardware</b></td></tr>
								<tr><td></td></tr>
								<tr><td>The
basic Model II is contained in one compact, desktop cabinet including a
built-in 8" disk drive for storina Drwrams anddata. a hiahresolution
12" v;deo &amp;splay, and a detachgble kevboard desianed to be similar
to the famihar electric type&amp;ter keyboard. It is simple to use.
There are as few "special keys" as necessary to do the job. For faster
and more accurate numeric input, a calculator-type keypad with . its
own ENTER key is provided. Model II's high-resolution video screen will
display 24 lines of 80 upper and lower case characters. Optionally,
double-width characters-40 per line-can be selected by your program.</td></tr>
								<tr><td></td></tr>
								<tr><td>Model
II is available with either 32K or 64K of Random Access Memory (RAM).
This means you can store 32,000 or 64,000 characters of information in
the computer's internal memory.</td></tr>
								<tr><td></td></tr>
								<tr><td>The
disk drive provides 416,000 characters of storage for your programs and
data on interchangeable "floppy" diskettes. If that's not enough, just
plug in a Model II Disk Expansion Unit with one, two or three more
drives. Each added drive stores another 486,000 characters, bringing
the total capacity of a four-drive system to about two-million
characters. To fill this amount of memorv would require something like
96 hours of non-stop typing at 70 words per minute! Of course, a 32K
Model II can be expanded to the full 64K of interhal memory at any
time, via our 32K RAM Add-On option.</td></tr>

								<tr><td>TRS-80
Model II is easily expanded to cope with growing or changing
reqmrements. It won't become obsolete in a few years. Connectors allow
you to add printers, plotters, digitizers, communications with
data-bases and other computers and a host of options. Internal plug-in
card slots are also provided for later options. Model II includes a
comprehensive reference manual and a diskette that contains the very
powerful Model II Interpretive BASIC language and "TRSDOS" disk
operating system. Additional programming languages are also available.
withthem, a large number of specialized pre-written software packages
in these languages can be used with your Model II, often with little or
no modifications. These programs include COBOL, FORTRAN, Compiler BASIC
and Editor assembler. Like all TRS-80 computers, Model II is U.L.
listed. For value; versatility ease of use, and support, you can't beat
the Model II. It's all business!</td></tr>

								<tr><td>All
of Model II's operating software is loaded into Random-Access Memory
from the system diskette every time you power-up the computer. So
whatever language you choose, it leaves the maximum available user
memory No addressable memorv s[ace is committed to Read-Only Memory
(ROM). The Model II contains just a small amount of ROMthat merely
loads the operating software, then is switched out.</td></tr>

Model II BASIC is an easy-to-use, expanded version of our Level II
interpretive language. It's a 17K disk-based interpreter, and features
detailed error flagging and quick editing that makes it especially easy
to use for program development and debugging.</td></tr>

II BASIC is an enhanced version of our Level II language. So if you can
program in Level II, you'll find Model II BASIC very familiar, and a

								</li><li>Ability to execute a TRSDOS command and return to BASIC with program and variables intact
								</li><li>Special functions to allow BASIC programs to call machine language subroutines
								</li><li>Recovery
from operator errors - the System won't stop if you attempt output to a
device which is not ready (such as Printer or Disk Drive) </li></td></tr>
								<tr><td></td></tr>
								<tr><td>Command
compatibility has heen maintained to the greatest possible extent for
the convenience of Model I and III owners who decide to move up to the
additional speed and capability of the Model II. And its language does

								<tr><td>TRSDOS
occupes space on the System diskette. It's automatically loaded and
ready for use after system power-on. however, only a small portion is
actually in memory at any one time. The Supervisor Program,
input/output drivers, and other essentials are always in memory.
Auxillary code is loaded as needed into an "overlay area."</td></tr>

II TRSDOS provides a full set of library commands and utility programs;
and, in addition, many useful system routiens can be called directly by
user programs.</td></tr>
								<tr><td></td></tr>
								<tr><td>Some
of the 37 Library Commands include: ATTRIB - changes a file's password.
CREAT - preallocates data file space for added execution speed. COPY
and MOVE -- allow files to be transferred. DEBUG -- lets you program,
test, and isolate errors in machine language programs. DO - automatic
power-up execution of a sequence of commands. FORMS - sets printer page
length and width, line width, top of forms, and lets you toggle
parallel or serial printer drivers. HELP - asists in clarifying TRSDOS
command syntax. PATCH - modifies the code in our system's software so
you can implement updates we provide. RENAME - change sthe name of a
file. SPOOL - saves printer output in a disk file for later printing,
and also allows printing at the same time other operations are being
entered.</td></tr>
								<tr><td></td></tr>
								<tr><td>The Utility Programs are:  BACKUP - copes a diskette.  FORMAT - organizes a diskette.  MEMTEST - checks out RAM.</td></tr>
								<tr><td></td></tr>
								<tr><td>In
addition, you have a complete set of communications commands. EXHO -
begins echo of keyboard input to display. HOST - allows keyboard input
from and video output to a remote terminal. RECEIVE - inputs data into
RAM from serial interface. SETCOM - sets RS-232 port paramters.
TERMINATL - comprehensive and versatile menu-driven ASCII
communications program.</td></tr>
								<tr><td></td></tr>
								<tr><td>Machine
language porgrammers can use Supervisor Calls which are Operating
System routines. They can be used without worrying about hard address
changes which could occur in later software releases. The routines
alter certain System functions and conditions; provide file access;
perform I/O to the keyboard, video display, and printer; plus perform
various computations.</td></tr>
								<tr><td></td></tr>
								<tr><td>TRSDOS
also allows keyaheads of up to 80 characters. This means that through
buffered storage, you can type in the next command while previous ones
are being executed.</td></tr>
								<tr><td></td></tr>
								<tr><td>Model
II TRSDOS responds to your commands with positive feedback. If you say
"KILL 'filen-anem,'" TRSDOS will responde with "'file-name' KILLED," or
"'file-name' NOT FOUND," so you'll always know what was or was not
accomplished by your command. And duplicating of a diskette requires
knowledge of a master password, which give you additional program and
data security.</td></tr>
								<tr><td></td></tr>
								<tr><td>Plus,
when an Operating System error occurs, a message appears on the video
screen with a numbered error code. And if you don't remember the
particular error, simply type "Error 66," for example, and Model II
will respond with a detailed explanation.</td></tr>
