<center><h1>TRS-80 Model II Error Messages</h1>

<p></p><pre>There are three kinds of error messages you might get while
using your computer:

     .    <b>Boot errors</b>, such as BOOT ERROR DC. See the
          <a href="#booterr">Boot Errors Table</a> for more information.

     .    <b>Operating system errors</b>, such as ERROR 24 or
          FILE NOT FOUND. To get a brief description of a
          numbered error, type ERROR followed by the error
          number displayed. For example, type:

                      ERROR 31 (ENTER)

          and your screen shows:

                      PROGRAM NOT FOUND

          For more information see the <a href="#oserr">System Errors Table</a>.

     .    <b>Application program errors</b> -- see your application
          program manual.
 

When an error message is displayed:

     .    Try the operation several times.

     .    Look up boot errors and operating system errors in
          the following tables and take the recommended
          actions. See your application program manual for
          explanations of application program errors.

     .    Try using other diskettes.

     .    Reset the computer and try the operation again.

     .    Check all the power connections.

     .    Check all interconnections.

     .    Remove all diskettes from drives, turn off the
          computer, wait 15 seconds, and turn it on again.

     .   If you tried all these remedies and continue to get
         an error message, contact a Radio Shack Service
         Center.

Note: If more than one thing is wrong, the computer might
wait until you correct the first error before displaying the
second error message.

These codes are also returned to machine code routines
that call a SVC (System Service Call) of TRSDOS-II.
Register A usually has a return code after any function
call. The Z flag is set when no error occurs. Exceptions
are certain computational routines, which use Registers A
and F to pass back data and status information.
