. M1FORMAT/FIX - 01/24/98 - Tim Mann
. Patch to Model I LDOS 5.3.1 FORMAT to allow formatting a hard
.  drive.  NOPs out some buggy code that makes it fail.  Odd
.  that this bug is still present; README/TXT suggests it was
.  fixed.  This patch is required to format an emulated hard 
.  drive with XTRSHARD/DCT on an emulated Model I. 
.
. Apply with PATCH FORMAT/CMD.RS0LT0FF USING M1FORMAT
. Do not apply to Model III LDOS or Model 4 LS-DOS!
