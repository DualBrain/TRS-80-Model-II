[1mDescription[0m
       [1mcmddump  [22mdisplays  information about TRS-80 DOS binary (command) files.
       It takes an optional set of [4mflags[24m  (described  below),  an  input  /cmd
       file, and an optional [4moutfile[24m, an optional starting offset of [4mstartbyte[0m
       into the /cmd file, and an optional [4mnbytes[24m number  of  bytes  to  dump.
       Non-flag  arguments  must be given in the order shown.  If the optional
       arguments are given, the given byte range is dumped from the  simulated
       memory after loading.
