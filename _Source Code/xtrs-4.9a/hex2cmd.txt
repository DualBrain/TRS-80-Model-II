[1mDescription[0m
       [1mhex2cmd [22mreads the specified [4minfile[24m (or standard input if none is given)
       in Intel hex format (also known  as  S-record  format),  and  writes  a
       TRS-80  CMD file to standard output.  An S-record that asks for 0 bytes
       to be loaded at address A sets the transfer address  (entry  point)  of
       the CMD file to A; otherwise the CMD file is given no transfer address.
